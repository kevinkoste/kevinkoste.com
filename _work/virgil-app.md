# Virgil Mobile App

This React Native app was built to demonstrate our teamâ€™s concept of
a high-engagement card app. We drew design inspiration from Co-Star
and Mr. Porter, and tried to mimic best practices in layout and
navigation from leading personal finance apps.

The app was mostly pure React Native, but we used some libraries to
support svg animations. We developed the majority of the app using
Expo, but we had to eject to use Plaid Link.

We are still working on a version of this app that uses a Plaid Link
integration to pull user spending data from an existing credit/debit
card.
