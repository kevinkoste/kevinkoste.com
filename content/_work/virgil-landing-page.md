## Virgil

In January 2020, I teamed up with two friends to build a consumer credit card company.

## Problem

We learned that the traditional barriers to entry for card issuing were falling thanks to financial infrastructure companies like Synapse, Marqeta, i2c, and Galileo.

Card companies have two sources of revenue - fees, which include interest charges, annual fees and late fees; and interchange, which is the ~2-3% of spending that the card company gets from the merchant on every swipe.

Most card programs are designed to maximize one of these revenue streams. 62% of American Express's revenue comes from interchange. Discover generates only 8.3% of their revenue from interchange - the rest is from fees. Capital One middles at 17%. [[source]](https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-do-credit-card-companies-make-money)

It follows that there are two business models for a card company.
1. Fees - target low-income consumers (credit score < 650), advertise access to credit 
2. Interchange - target high-income consumers (credit score > 750), advertise rewards 

There are many fintech startups building for the low-income market, often with an alternative underwriting strategy/model. We decided to focus on the high-income market.
