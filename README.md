This is my personal website. It's a Next.js static site hosted on Netlify. I'm using remark to automatically convert Markdown files into portfolio pages (work) and articles (blog). This serves as a minimal CMS that I can activate by adding a new .md file and pushing to main.

Tech:
- React Framework: Next.js
- Styles: CSS modules
- Deployment: Netlify
- Markdown -> HTML: remark and gray-matter

To-do:
- [x] Set up analytics
- [ ] Get next/image optimization working in prod
- [ ] Write excellent content!
